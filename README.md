📌 Project Overview
In this Splunk training project, I followed a hands-on approach to practice the core features of Splunk. The workflow included the following steps:

📁 1. Dataset Upload to Splunk
I started by uploading a sample dataset to Splunk and indexing it properly for analysis.

🔍 2. Testing Search Queries
I explored different SPL (Search Processing Language) queries to filter and analyze the data.

📊 3. Creating Reports
Finally, I created a basic report from the search results to visualize key patterns and insights.

By completing these steps, I was able to apply and test multiple Splunk functions including data indexing, search, filtering, and reporting — essential tasks in a real SOC (Security Operations Center) environment.
